# School_District_Analysis

# Overview of the school district analysis
* The purpose of this analysis was to clean up the potentital dishonest scores from the 9th grade class of Thomas High School, as well as gain insight into the school district data by maintaining the rest of the data and creating multiple summaries explaining the overall analysis.

# Results
* The district summary was affected by the dishonest scores and brought Thomas High School into the bottom 5 schools in the per_school_summary. Based on budgets, although, the charter schools out-performed the district schools, larger budgets were linked to several of the district school systems.

* The school summary shows a direct correlation with the size of the school vs the passing scores. Typically, schools with lower school counts outperformed the schools with larger school counts.

* As mentioned in the district summary, the overall scores were affected once the dishonest 9th scores were cleaned from the data. This dropped the school's performance into the bottom 5 schools out of both districts combined.
